## About the WineZ ##
<br>

Name of this web shop app is ***WineZ üçá***, it's made as a seminar paper as part of my faculty obligations. <br>
Project is separated in 2 main parts:
* Frontend,
* Backend,
* VinotekaDB (which is manipulated through backed code).

<br>
There is 2 main roles on this page:
* Administrator,
* User.

<br>
User authentication is implemented on backend using JWT in which UserID and UserRole are stored.<br>
It's done with httpOnly requests, which prevents frontend part of the app to manipulate with token, which means that it can be done only by sending the token on backend where informations from token will be extraced using JWT_SECRET key. This WoW ensures safe manipulation over user data.
<br>

Administrator role have the following rights:
* Delete/Edit users,
* Promote user to the Administrator role,
* Create, Update and Delete Products,
* Create, Update and Delete Producers -> Producer cannot be deleted if it have any product connected to itself in the DB.

<br>
User role have the following rights:
* Register new account,
* Login,
* Search Products,
* Search Producers,
* See product Details.

<br>
