## About WineZ

The name of this web shop app is **WineZ üçá**. It was created as a seminar paper as part of my faculty obligations. The project is separated into 3 main parts:
* Frontend
* Backend
* VinotekaDB (which is manipulated through backed code).

There are 2 main roles on this page:
* Administrator
* User

User authentication is implemented on the backend using JWT in which UserID and UserRole are stored. It's done with httpOnly requests, which prevents the frontend part of the app from manipulating with the token, meaning that it can be done only by sending the token to the backend where information from the token will be extracted using the JWT_SECRET key. This ensures safe manipulation over user data.

Administrator role has the following rights:
* Delete/Edit users
* Promote users to the Administrator role
* Create, Update, and Delete Products
* Create, Update, and Delete Producers (a Producer cannot be deleted if it has any product connected to itself in the DB).

User role has the following rights:
* Register a new account
* Login
* Search Products
* Search Producers
* See product details
